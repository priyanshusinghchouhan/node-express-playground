# 🚀 node-express-playground

Welcome to my **Express + Node.js Playground** — a personal repository where I document my backend development journey by building mini projects, experimenting with core concepts, and applying what I learn.

## 📌 About This Repo

This repo is my **hands-on workspace** for:

- Practicing **Node.js** and **Express.js**
- Exploring **backend fundamentals**
- Creating small, real-world **mini projects**
- Logging progress and experiments
- Refactoring code as I grow

> 💡 Learn → Build → Break → Fix → Repeat
